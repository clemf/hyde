title: How I made this blog using Jekyll, Poole, and Github Pages
---

I'm currently attending [Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com/), which is an intensive 17-week programming bootcamp in Portland, Oregon. As part of my goal of becoming a developer I've been wanting to create a blog. I want to practice writing and also document my learning process.

[Jekyll](http://http://jekyllrb.com/) is a static site generator that is works well with [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com). Instead of using a dynamic CMS like Wordpress where everything is created on-the-fly from a database, Jekyll generates all HTML/CSS/Javascript locally. This makes extremely fast and lightweight websites that are easy to administer (for developers, at least).
